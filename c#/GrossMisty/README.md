# GrossMisty

Childish, immature, and funny skill that farts and burps at random times, and when you press the bump sensors.

Uses the SkillTools library for asset management; built from the SkillTools repository in https://github.com/MistyCommunity/.NET-SDK.

Has one optional startup parameter that can be passed into the skill to force it to update existing assets on the robot with the assets in the Assets/SkillAssets folder.

- ReloadAssets, defaults to false. Setting to true will update all the assets, even if they already exist on the robot.  If false, will only upload assets if they do not exist on the robot.
